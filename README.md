# Japanese Helper

Semester project for the course "Industrial Strength Multilingual Analysis" at Universität Tübingen, Winter Semester 17-18. This application analyzes Japanese text and displays information about the text that helps English learners, including word segmentation, translation, pronunciation, inflection information etc.

You can import it as a Maven project in Eclipse/IntelliJ IDEA and launch it as a GWT application, after having installed [the GWT plugin](http://gwt-plugins.github.io/documentation/gwt-eclipse-plugin/Download.html). Remember to check whether the resources folder is excluded from the Build Path. If so, un-exclude it before building and launching the project.

For detailed documentation, refer to [the report](Report.pdf).
