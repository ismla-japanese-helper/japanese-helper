# Japanese Helper

Semester project for the course "Industrial Strength Multilingual Language Analysis" at Universität Tübingen, Winter Semester 17-18. This application analyzes Japanese text and displays information about the text that helps English-speaking learners of Japanese, including word segmentation, translation, pronunciation, inflection information etc.

You can import it as a Maven project in Eclipse/IntelliJ IDEA and launch it as a GWT application, after having installed [the GWT plugin](http://gwt-plugins.github.io/documentation/gwt-eclipse-plugin/Download.html). Remember to check whether the resources folder is excluded from the Build Path. If so, include it before building and launching the project.

For detailed documentation (information about the project, its use cases, implementation, linguistic background, plus screenshots), please refer to the PDF report in the `/doc` folder.
